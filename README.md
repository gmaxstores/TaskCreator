# Overview

As a software engineer, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new technologies. This project is an opportunity for me to practice my Android development skills and learn how to build a simple application using modern Android development tools.

This is a simple task management application that allows users to create a profile, create tasks with a name, description, and due date, and view a list of their tasks. The app is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean and intuitive user interface.

My purpose for creating this app is to gain experience with Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. I am also using this project to learn how to use other modern Android development tools, such as ViewModel, Room, and Jetpack Navigation.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to develop this application. The app is written in Kotlin and uses the following libraries:

*   **Jetpack Compose:** A modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
*   **ViewModel:** A class that is responsible for preparing and managing the data for a UI component.
*   **Room:** A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access.
*   **Jetpack Navigation:** A library that helps you navigate between different screens in your app.

# Future Work

*   Implement data persistence for the user profile.
*   Add cloud sync to allow users to access their tasks from multiple devices.
*   Add support for reminders and notifications.
*   Improve the UI and add more features, such as the ability to categorize tasks and set priorities.
